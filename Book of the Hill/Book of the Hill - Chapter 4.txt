Chapter 4
Sloviak, after parting with the freed, continued on, hoping that he was near the end of his journey. After journeying for several days, Sloviak came upon the mouth of a cavern, that he had not seen before. Upon entering the cavern, Sloviak was first drawn to a ray of bluish moonlight, that fell from what must have been a hole in the roof of the cavern, and there in the moonlight was the gem of his vision. As he admired it from the distance, it caught the light and reflected it back into the cavern, spilling out beams, as if it produced them itself. Sloviak started toward the gem, and as he went he took note of his surroundings. The cavern was the largest he'd ever seen, with no sight of the roof, except for the opening where the moonlight streamed in. Gems studded the walls in irregular patterns, and metal ores glimmered in shining veins along the floor, all reflecting the already reflected moonlight. 

When Sloviak touched the gem he entered a trance, in which Ulaa spoke to him saying. "Blessings be upon you Sloviak, for you have found your reward. Yet during your journey, you have also brought disappointment, for the ways stealth, and deception are not my ways, and though you did so to perform a noble deed, you still went against my will, and for this you must atone." To which Sloviak replied "Forgive me my lady, for I was brooding hate, and not kindness when I performed these action, and thus did not have a clear head to follow your ways. What may I do to atone for this wrong?" "For I see in your heart that your motives were good, and I see the hope of going home that you have given the freed, therefore for your atonement, you must deliver upon this hope, and return them to their homes, even though some live far from here." Ulaa intoned. "Then it shall be done my lady." said Sloviak. With this, Sloviak left his trance and gathered the gem in his hands.
